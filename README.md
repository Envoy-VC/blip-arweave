## Getting Started üöÄ

### üìù Smart Contract

To get started with Blip smart contracts, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the contracts directory and locate the contracts under the `src` folder.
2. Install the necessary dependencies by running the following command:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Build the contracts by running the build command:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
4. To run the tests located in the tests folder, use the following command:

   ```bash
   npm run test
   ```

   This will execute the `blip.test.ts` file and run the tests.

5. If you wish to deploy your contract to the mainnet, there is a deploy script available in the `tools` folder. Before running the script, make sure to store your _JWK Key_ in a folder named "`keys`" with the file name "`jwk.json`".
6. To deploy the contract, run the following command:
   ```bash
   npx ts-node tools/deploy-contract.ts
   ```

Additionally, there is already a deployed contract on the mainnet with the contract address:

```
a-mJI2Mb3puHbi1Md5TYNFMNVyvKDPwx1yHBafpE7mc
```

You can view the Contract in the [explorer](https://sonar.warp.cc/#/app/contract/a-mJI2Mb3puHbi1Md5TYNFMNVyvKDPwx1yHBafpE7mc?network=mainnet)

### üì± Blip App

To get started with the Blip frontend app, follow these steps:
Navigate to the app directory and install the necessary dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

Create a new file called `.env.local` in the root directory of the `app`. This file will contain the required environment variables.
Inside the `.env.local` file, add the following environment variables:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_THIRDWEB_CLIENT_ID=''
NEXT_PUBLIC_LIVEPEER_API_KEY=''
```

To obtain the thirdweb Client Id, you can visit the [thirdweb Dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard) and retrieve the API key from there.

Similarly, for the Livepeer API, you can obtain it from the [Livepeer Studio dashboard](https://livepeer.studio/dashboard).

Once you have filled in the environment variables in the `.env.local` file, you can start the development server by running the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to access the Blip app.

By following these steps, you will be able to set up and run the Blip contracts and front-end app on your local development environment.

Enjoy exploring the features and functionalities of Blip!
